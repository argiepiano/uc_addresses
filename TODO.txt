TO DO LIST:

 * Add a checkbox to the checkout delivery and billing addresses to
   select whether to save the associated address. Currently, these
   addresses are always saved (unless they are already in the
   database).

 * If an anonymous user places an order using an existing e-mail
   address, the order is attached to the account associated with the
   e-mail, but the addresses are not added to that account.
