------------------------------
- by MegaChriz: little correction in upgrade script.
- Issue #1368162 by MegaChriz: added odd/even classes for "other addresses"
  in the address book.
- by MegaChriz: the property '#uc_addresses_required' of the
  uc_addresses_address now accept arrays, the required-setting of address
  fields can now be overridden before the uc_addresses_address element
  is processed.

Ubercart Addresses 6.x-2.x-dev, 2011-11-25
------------------------------
- by MegaChriz: removed unused functions uc_addresses_get_field_handlers()
  and uc_addresses_compare().
- by MegaChriz: replaced property '#required' in the uc_addresses_address
  form element with '#uc_addresses_required'. Setting this to FALSE makes
  all address fields non-required (even if they are configured to be
  required). The field handlers were adjusted to fit with this change.
- by MegaChriz: setting a default value for the property
  '#uc_addresses_address' for the uc_addresses_address form element is moved
  to the process function. This is done to increase performance: CTools'
  plugin system is no longer unnecessary invoked on every request with a
  form.
- by MegaChriz: other minor changes.
